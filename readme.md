WHAT ARE SOME IDEAS
THEME IS IDENTITY

Nature vs Nurture (as the identity law of the product you build)

Pieces of Identity
Mathematic Identities LMAO (equation A = equation B always => somehow connect that to human identity???? maybe)
Connect identities with one another
Identity as a community not just as an individual
Past Present and Future Identities

maybe a simulation?
Make a set of N players that each have different attributes in some way or another and put them in an environment to see how they diverge???
idk it seems too much like a demonstration of a philosophy point than an actual project for a hackathon

Thomas Idea:
Monkeys and a ladder and banana on top
whenever a monkey climbs the ladder the scientist poured water on them to drop them
then when a new monkey goes up the ladder but is dragged down by the older monkeys
So the new monkeys learn to drag down the newer monkeys even after the water system is removed
The idea of people's nature changing because of others and their identity being formed without them even knowing why themselves
Simulate this with some AI system maybe?
Primer Youtube Channel has some pretty cool simulation stuff

Back Burner Idea:
- Basically an AI that copies you based on your texting style and habits, search recommendations/habits, time of being awake, and etc. (idea of what separates a Human identity and a Robot's identity) ((Dead Internet Theory))

Include a create your own character and see how they live
